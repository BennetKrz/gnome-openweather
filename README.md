OpenWeather (*gnome-shell-extension-openweather*) is a simple extension for displaying weather conditions and forecasts for any location on Earth in the GNOME Shell. It provides support for multiple locations with editable names using coordinates to store the locations, a beautiful layout, and more.

Weather data is fetched from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org) including forecasts for up to ten days.

*This is a fork of the original [OpenWeather](https://gitlab.com/jenslody/gnome-shell-extension-openweather) extension by @jenslody.*

**NOTE: Currently this leads to the older version of the extension before the fork while we [transfer ownership of the E.G.O listing](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Infrastructure/extensions-web/-/issues/185). I will upload a new version as soon as it's complete!**

To get the latest release you will need to use one of the below options for now:

### Package Manager

I have added an 'official' package to the AUR that will align with the E.G.O releases. However I'm not aware of this fork updated on any other package manager repositories yet. I will add them here as they become available.

#### [Arch Linux (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages?O=0&K=gnome-shell-extension-openweather)

For the latest 'official' version releases:

```
paru -S gnome-shell-extension-openweather
```

A 3rd party maintains a rolling release package synced with this git repo:

```
paru -S gnome-shell-extension-openweather-git
```

### Install From Source

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
* `dconf`
* `gettext`
* `pkg-config`
* `git`
* `glib2` (and development packages)
* `zip`
* `gnome-common`
* `autoconf`
* `automake`
* `gettext-devel`
* `gnome-extensions`

Run the following commands:

```
cd ~ && git clone https://gitlab.com/skrewball/openweather.git
cd ~/openweather
./autogen.sh && make local-install
```

<br>

## Configuration

Launch the *gnome-extensions* app look for the *OpenWeather* extension and click to activate. The settings can be accessed here and are also reachable through the settings button on the extension popup.

You can also use *dconf-editor* or *gsettings* to configure the extension through the command line.
- The settings are under the `org.gnome.shell.extensions.openweather` schema.

With [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org) you can either use the extensions default-key or register to get a [personal API key](https://openweathermap.org/appid). This key has to be added in the preferences dialog. Don't forget to switch the a appropriate switch in the dialog to "off" in this case.

When submitting a bug report, please make sure to provide as much information as you can about the issue, your Linux distribution, GNOME Shell version, and OpenWeather (*gnome-shell-extension-openweather*) version.
