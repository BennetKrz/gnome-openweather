OpenWeather (*gnome-shell-extension-openweather*) is a simple extension for displaying weather conditions and forecasts for any location on Earth in the GNOME Shell. It provides support for multiple locations with editable names using coordinates to store the locations, a beautiful layout, and more.

Weather data is fetched from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org) including 3 hour forecasts for up to five days.

*Forked from the original OpenWeather extension by @jenslody.*

### Package Manager

I have an 'official' package in the AUR that aligns with the E.G.O releases. However I'm not aware if any package maintainers have updated their sources yet. I will add them here as they become available.

#### [Arch Linux (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages?O=0&K=gnome-shell-extension-openweather)

For the latest official E.G.O version releases:

```
paru -S gnome-shell-extension-openweather
```

A 3rd party maintains a rolling release package synced with this git repo:

```
paru -S gnome-shell-extension-openweather-git
```
